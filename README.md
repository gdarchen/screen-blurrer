# Screen blurrer

At INSA Rouen, this project was done during a week-long hackathon.

In Python using the OpenCV library, development of an application enabling the user to use his computer and displaying the image recorded by the webcam as soon as a person appears behind him. Thus, on the displayed image, a green frame indicates the location of the new detected face so as to let the user know who is spying him.

## Easter eggs
There exists two other modes as the one presented before : a "zen" mode displaying a code snapshot as soon as a third person appears behind the screen, and an "ironman" mode displaying an IronMan mask on every detected people.
